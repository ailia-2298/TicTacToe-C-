# TicTacToe-C++
  This was my first attempt in making a tic tac toe game. Its not that good and the function calling is very complex, yet anyone with the basic knowledge of c++ can understand it easily. 
  It displays a menu everytime for selecting different options.. like Player VS Player mode or Player VS Computer mode...
  It can load a saved game from a file. Press s anytime between the game to save the  particular state of the game. Also, you can delete any record from the file as well.
  Play and you can easily understand how it works.
